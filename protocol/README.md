# Gamium Protocol

This package defines the protocol for communication between the gamium engine and the client.

## Requirements

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/ko) 16 or higher
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Get started

```code
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
yarn run export
```

The yarn export command builds the docker image required for flatbuffer export and runs it through that image.
