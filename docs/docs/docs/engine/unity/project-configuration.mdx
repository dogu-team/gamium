To use `Gamium`, you must add `Gamium Engine SDK` to your project.
The `Gamium Engine SDK` performs the functions requested by the `Gamium Client` to help you proceed with automated testing.

## Requirements

- Unity 2020.3.0f1 or higher

## 1. Add Gamium Engine SDK

In [Project manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html), add to `dependencies` as follows.

```
"com.dogu.gamium.engine.unity": "https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium.git?path=/engine/unity#1.0.1",
```

:::info
The source code and example project for the Gamium Engine SDK can be found at the link below

- [gamium](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium)
- [gamium-unity-samples](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples)

:::

## 2. Add Scripting Define Symbol

A `Scripting Define Symbol` called **`USE_GAMIUM`** is required for `Gamium` to work. **Only when `USE_GAMIUM`** is set will the `Gamium Engine` run normally.
Go to the topic `Script Compilation` using the [Custom scripting symbols](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomScriptingSymbols.html) guide and add **`USE_GAMIUM`**).

:::tip
The `Gamium Engine SDK` has been added to the project, but if you do not want to run `Gamium Engine`, you must turn off **`USE_GAMIUM`**.

## 3. Add Initialization Code

The following code can be added to run `Gamium Engine`.
[ServerBuilder](server-configuration) provides functions such as input mapping and event handler registration, and please refer to [Server Configuration](server-configuration) for more information.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Gamium;
using UnityEngine;

public class GamiumServerStarter
{
    [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad)]
    private static void OnLoad()
    {
        new ServerBuilder().Run();
    }
}
```

## 4. Check the log

If the following log is output from the 'Unity Editor', the 'Gamium Engine' has been executed normally.

<img src={unity_gamium_update_log} style={{ width: 500 }} />

## 5. Build

Check [Build Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html) to create an executable after building unity.
You can proceed with test automation with that executable file.
