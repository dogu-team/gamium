# Gamium Client

Gamium Client communicates with the Gamium Engine. You can request game status inquiry, virtual input such as keyboard and mouse. You can script the input according to the flow you want by mixing virtual input and conditional loop statements. Write and run scripts to automate the tests you want.

There are SDKs for each language of the Gamium Client SDK, and you need to use the SDK suitable for the language you want to write.
