## Setting up your local environment

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium.git
$ cd gamium
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium.git
$ git fetch upstream
```

### Step 2: Build

Build steps and dependencies differ slightly depending on your game engine. See these detailed guides on building Gamium locally:

#### Engine

ðŸš§ **work in progress** ðŸš§  
ðŸš§ link to use local unity engine library source code ðŸš§

#### Client

ðŸš§ **work in progress** ðŸš§  
ðŸš§ link to use local typescript client source code ðŸš§

Once you've built the project locally, you're ready to start making changes!

### Step 3: Branch

To keep your development environment organized, create local branches to hold your work. These should be branched directly off of the main branch.

```sh
git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/main
```

## Making Changes

### Step 4: Code

Most pull requests opened against the dogu-team/gamium repository include changes to either the protocol in the protocol/ folder, the client in the client/ folder, the server in the server/ folder, the documentation in docs/ folder.
