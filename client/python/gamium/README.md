## Description

Gamium provides the ability to script the behavior of game users. Starting from a simple function of clicking on the UI, you can automate various cases and be free from repetitive manual tests.

Automation starts when the gamium client sends a network message to the gamium engine for the specified command.
Users just need to put the gamium engine into the game build and send the specified message using the client sdk.

You can look up the UI and then click and scroll,  
You can simulate input into the game,  
You can also call specific functions.
