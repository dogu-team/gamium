Please refer to the picture below and check if you use [Input Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html) or [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@latest).  
Go to [`Project Settings`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html) -> `Player` => `Other Settings` => `Active Input Handling` and you'll find out.

## When using Input Manager

Unity [`Input`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html) You need to modify where you use the class to use `Gamium.Input`.
Please use [`using`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive) to `alias` at the top of the file as shown below.

:::tip
`Gamium.Input` provides the same API as UnityInput.
The difference is that `Gamium.Input` also returns values entered through the function [`sendKey`](../../gamium-client/api/classes/gamium-client#sendkey-) of `Gamium Engine`.
:::

### Usage

```csharp
#if USE_GAMIUM
using Input = Gamium.Input;
#endif

```

## When using Input Manager

There is no further action to be taken. However, there are not many games tested with Input System yet, so it may be unstable.
