## Key input

User keystrokes can be simulated through `Gamium Client`.
[KeyBy](api/classes/key-by) allows you to specify the key input method.

You can use it as below.

```ts
await gamium.sendKey(KeyBy.unityKeycode('Space'));
await gamium.sendKey(KeyBy.unityKeyboard('Space'));
```

## ActionChain

When manipulating the game through the `Gamium Client`, if you want to perform multiple actions continuously, you can use the `Action Chain` (api/classes/action-chain) to perform the action at the most accurate time.

You can add multiple actions to [`ActionChain`](api/classes/action-chain). When you call the performance() of [`ActionChain`](api/classes/action-chain), the added actions are performed sequentially.

You can combine several actions as shown below.

#### Usage

```ts
await gamium
  .actions()
  .move({ x: screen.width / 2, y: screen.height / 2 })
  .click({ x: screen.width / 2, y: screen.height / 2 })
  .perform();

await gamium
  .actions()
  .sendKeys([KeyBy.unityKeycode('W'), KeyBy.unityKeycode('A')])
  .sendKeys([KeyBy.unityKeycode('Space')])
  .perform();
```
