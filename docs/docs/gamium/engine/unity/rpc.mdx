Gamium provides the ability to remotely invoke functions contained in the Game through the `Gamium Client`.

The following C# code can be invoked through the function [executeRpc](../../gamium-client/api/classes/gamium-client#executeRpc-) in `Gamium Client`.

##### C#

```csharp
internal static class CodebaseSample
{
    public static void CallParam1(double param1)
    {
        Logger.Verbose($"CodebaseSample.CallParam1: {param1}");
    }
}
```

##### Typescript

```ts
await game.executeRpc(
  RpcBy.method('Gamium.Private.CodebaseSample', 'CallParam1', 10),
);
```

### Restrictions

- Only static functions can be called
- Only types such as int, float, and string can be passed as factors and used as return values
