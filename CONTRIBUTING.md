### Languages

We accept issues in _any_ language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.
