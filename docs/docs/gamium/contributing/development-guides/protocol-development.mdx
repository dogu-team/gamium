# Protocol Development

## Update protocol

The Gamium protocol uses the Flatbuffer to create an interface for communication.

:::info
Flatbuffer is a binary serialization format that allows you to create a schema for your data and then compile it into a binary format that can be used in many different programming languages.  
syntax is similar to JSON, but it is much more efficient in terms of size and speed.
:::

:::danger
If you change the Gamium protocol, all engine and client interfaces must be checked.

### Step 1: Define schema

The schema files is located in the `protocol/fbs` folder.  
Please refer to [**Flatbuffer official schema document**](https://flatbuffers.dev/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html) for the grammar of flatbuffer.

### Step 2: Export protocol

```sh
cd protocol
yarn export
```

### Step 3: Update Unity meta files

```sh
cd utils/typescript/unity-meta-gen
yarn export
```

### Step 4: Development Engine and Client
