This page will be based on Unity and TypeScript.

### Prerequisites

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 16.0.0
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### DoguRpgSample project

In the case of Unity, there are [
gamium-unity-samples](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples) prepared in advance. Please open [DoguRpgSample](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples/tree/main/DoguRpgSample) during these projects
with Unity Editor.

### Play DoguRpgSample

1. Clone the [gamium-unity-samples](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples) git repository.
2. Open the `gamium-unity-samples/DoguRpgSample` directory with Unity Editor.
3. Open **Assets/Scenes/Login.unity** as shown in the screenshot below.
   <img src={unity_open_sample_login_scene} style={{ width: 600 }} />
4. Press the play button to confirm that the project is running normally.

Well done if the game is playing as below.

<img src={unity_dogurpgsample_editor} style={{ width: 600 }} />

The engine is now running without problems. Next, let's connect the client to the engine.

### Connect to the engine

1. Open the `gamium-unity-samples/client/typescript` directory with Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal and execute the following command.
   - This command initializes the automation script project, connects to the running gamium engine, and runs the automation script.

```bash
yarn install
yarn run:DoguRpgSample
```

If the test proceeds as shown in the screen below, you followed the guide well.

### Next thing to look around

- Take a look at [dogurpgsample-test.ts](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples/blob/main/client/typescript/test/dogurpgsample-test.ts). See how the script clicks the button. Also, look at how to buy items.
- You can learn what functions and how to control them with client scripts from [Client document](/docs/client/write-testscript) and [API document](/api/api-reference).
