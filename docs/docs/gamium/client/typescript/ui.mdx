You can obtain an object called [`UI`](api/classes/ui) through the [`Game Driver`](api/classes/gamium-client).
[`UI`](api/classes/ui) provides an interface for easy UI manipulation.

You can use it as below.

##### Usage

```ts
const ui = gamium.ui();
await ui.click(By.path('Object path'));
```

### Auto wait

If you are using the class [`UI`](api/classes/ui), automatically do the [`wait`](api/classes/ui-element) until you find it.
The above Usage works the same as below.

```ts
const button = await ui.wait(By.path('Object path'));
await gamium.wait(Until.elementInteractable(button));
await button.click();
```
