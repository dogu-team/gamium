# Gamium Client TypeScript

Gamium Client TypeScript is located in the `client/typescript/gamium` folder from the source root.

### Package Import

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 16.0.0 or later
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 4.7.4

#### Install

#### Open Node project

You need a node project. If there is no node project, please use the [**sample client project**](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples/tree/main/client/typescript).  
or you can use your node project.

#### Find local source code path

Clone the project on GitHub to local.
The Gamium Client TypeScript is located in the `client/typescript/gamium` folder from the source root.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium.git
$ cd client/typescript/gamium
$ pwd
```

Please remember the path output from pwd. This path is {gamium_client_typescript_local_path} which will be shown below.

#### Add the package to your project

You can import local node package through [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) file.
The file is located at `{your node project}/package.json`.
Looking for the file and replace `{gamium_client_typescript_local_path}` with the path to the Gamium Client Typescript source code path.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "gamium": "file:{gamium_client_typescript_local_path}"
  }
}
```

### Build and Run

- Install dependency packages through the yarn command in the node project path.

```sh
yarn
```

- Refer to [Write Test Script](../../client/write-testscript) documentation to import gamium and write the desired script.
- And run the typescript script you wrote.

### Generate API documentation

- API documentation can be generated via `{gamium-repo}/utils/docs-api-gen`. Go to gamium-repo in the shell and run the command below.

```
cd docs-api-gen
yarn
yarn run docs:typescript
```
