The 'Object path' is used by the 'Gamium Client' to query and manipulate the desired object.

:::info
The Object Path can be found using the methods below.

- [`Console Inspector`](/host-and-device/device/streaming-and-remote-control/game-ui-inspector)
- `Unity` - [`Gamium Editor`](../gamium-engine/unity/query-objects)

:::

<br />

Below is an example of using 'Object path' in 'Gamium Client'.

```ts
const cameraObj = await gamium.findObject(By.path('/Main Camera[1]'));
```

In the example above, we are looking for a camera using the 'Object path' called '/Main Camera [1]'. The reason for using the function [`By.path()`](api/classes/by.mdx) is to inform you that you are searching through 'Object path' among the object search methods.

<br />

Alternatively, you can find it using the tag as shown below.

```ts
const cameraObj = await gamium.findObject(By.tag('MainCamera'));
```
