import { GamiumClient } from '@dogu-tech/gamium-client/common';
import { NodeGamiumService } from '@dogu-tech/gamium-client/node';

const gamiumKit = await prepareGamium();
const gamiumService = new NodeGamiumService('127.0.0.1', port);
const gamiumClient = new GamiumClient(gamiumService);
await gamiumClient.connect();
const gamium = gamiumKit.gamium;
const ui = gamium.ui();
```

## Click Buton

Locate the Button Object you want to press, then write a script and click it.

```ts
await ui.click(By.path('Object path'));
```
