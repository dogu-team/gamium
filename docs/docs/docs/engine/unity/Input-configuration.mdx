Please refer to the picture below and check if you use [Input Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html) or [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@latest).  
Go to [`Project Settings`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html) -> `Player` => `Other Settings` => `Active Input Handling` and you'll find out.

## When using Input Manager

You need to modify where you use the class [`UnityEngine.Input`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html) to use `Gamium.Input`.
Look for files that use the input class. And insert the code below at the top of the file to use Gamium.Input instead of the existing Input.


### Usage

```csharp
#if USE_GAMIUM
using Input = Gamium.Input;
#endif

```

:::info
Gamium.Input provides the same API as UnityInput.
The difference is that Gamium.Input also process and simulate input requests sent by the Gamium Client.

If you don't want this, you don't have to alias as Gamium.Input.

## When using Input Manager

There is no further action to be taken. However, there are not many games tested with Input System yet, so it may be unstable.
